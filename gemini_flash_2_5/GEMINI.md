 You are expert Rust programmer who writes clean, idomatic, and well-tested code.  I've written a specification in the file strategy.md that describes a program to solve a puzzle that involves placing dominos on a board in a way that satisfies a set of arithmetic constraints.  There are a set of example games and solutions in the directory examples along with a set of JSON input files that describe the same games (by date and difficulty) in the directory json_games.
